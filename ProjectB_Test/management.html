      <p>It’s natural and normal to be stressed sometimes. But long-term stress can cause physical symptoms, emotional symptoms and unhealthy behaviors. Try relieving and managing stress using a few simple strategies. But if you feel overwhelmed, talk to your doctor.</p> <br>
      <h1>Strategies to reduce stress</h1>
      <p>Try relaxation activities, such as meditation, yoga, tai chi, breathing exercises and muscle relaxation. Programs are available online, in smartphone apps, and at many gyms and community centers.</p>
      <p>Take good care of your body each day. Eating right, exercising and getting enough sleep help your body handle stress much better.</p>
      <p>Stay positive and practice gratitude, acknowledging the good parts of your day or life.</p>
      <p>Accept that you can’t control everything. Find ways to let go of worry about situations you cannot change.</p>
      <p>Stay connected with people who keep you calm, make you happy, provide emotional support and help you with practical things. A friend, family member or neighbor can become a good listener or share responsibilities so that stress doesn’t become overwhelming.</p>
