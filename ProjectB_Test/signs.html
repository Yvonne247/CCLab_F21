      <p>Stress responses help your body adjust to new situations. Stress can be positive, keeping us alert, motivated and ready to avoid danger. For example, if you have an important test coming up, a stress response might help your body work harder and stay awake longer. But stress becomes a problem when stressors continue without relief or periods of relaxation.</p> <br>
      <p>When a person has long-term (chronic) stress, continued activation of the stress response causes wear and tear on the body. Physical, emotional and behavioral symptoms develop.</p> <br>
      <p>Physical symptoms of stress include: </p> <br>
      <p>Aches and pains.</p> <br>
      <p>Chest pain or a feeling like your heart is racing.</p> <br>
      <p>Exhaustion or trouble sleeping.</p> <br>
      <p>Headaches, dizziness or shaking.</p> <br>
      <p>High blood pressure.</p> <br>
      <p>Muscle tension or jaw clenching.</p> <br>
      <p>Stomach or digestive problems.</p> <br>
      <p>Trouble having sex.</p> <br>
      <p>Weak immune system.</p> <br> <br>
      <p>Stress can lead to emotional and mental symptoms like:

      Anxiety or irritability.
      Depression.
      Panic attacks.
      Sadness.</p> <br>
      <p>Often, people with chronic stress try to manage it with unhealthy behaviors, including:

      Drinking alcohol too much or too often.
      Gambling.
      Overeating or developing an eating disorder.
      Participating compulsively in sex, shopping or internet browsing.
      Smoking.
      Using drugs.</p>
