<h1>Album: Semicolon</h1>
<p class="introduction"><b>Semicolon</b> (stylized as ; [Semicolon]) is a special extended play (EP) by South Korean boy band Seventeen. It was released through Pledis Entertainment on October 19, 2020.
<br><br>
The album consists of six tracks, including the lead single <b>"Home;Run"</b>, all of which have been co-written by the band members. The album touches upon themes of youth, encouragement, and comfort. The opening track, <b>"Home;Run"</b> is an uptempo '20s and '30s swing and dance-pop song, with a retro-indebted sound. The song incorporates strong brass sound, "chipper" finger-snaps, cheerful beats and jazz-inflected piano harmony in its production and Asian instruments in its bridge. <b>The lyrics emphasize the passion of youth and deliver comfort to the listener through baseball metaphors</b>. Elaborating on the sound and the lyrics, Woozi explained, <b>"We expressed the feeling of hitting a home run with a rhythmical and hard-hitting sound."</b>

Commercially, the album reached number one on South Korea's Gaon Album Chart and number two on the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart.</p>
